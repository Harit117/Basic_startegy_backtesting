# Basic_startegy_backtesting

This project builds a complete backtesting pipeline using Python and Backtrader to evaluate a dual-indicator strategy based on SMA crossovers and MACD momentum signals. It simulates trades across multiple tickers (SPY, AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, IBM, DIS, HOOD), allocating 100% of available capital per signal. The system calculates key metrics such as win ratio, percent capital increase, Sharpe Ratio, and annualized returns for each asset. A final bar chart visualizes the annualized performance, allowing intuitive comparison across stocks. This framework serves as a robust foundation for quant strategy validation and extension into portfolio-level optimization.
